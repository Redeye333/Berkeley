Overview

The predictive model for stock data was fairly accurate when looking at data over time.  However, today was interesting in that there was news which lowered
the Tesla stock price.  Just basing stock market predictions based on trends and price movements proves to be risky.  In this case, Ford lowered the price of
their electric vehicles which pushed Tesla's stock down 3%.  The time series based models are interesting but there are so many factors that can move the price
of a stock that it's not always predictable.  There are irrational market movements and any predictive algorithm would not be able to adjust for everything.

That said, I think some of this can be mitigated by looking at data such as deritive (options) volume.  For example, looking at how many people have open positions
to short a stock will inherently account for many of these variables, such as competition, earnings calls and other macro factors.  This may be a next step in my model for
the final submission.


Approach
I used yfinance to pull real time data as opposed to pulling static data.  This will help ensure we can re-run the code at any given time to pull predictive data.
This is critical to ensure the code can be used with minimal effort.

I relied heavily on the close price of the stock which is primarily used to show price movements and trends.

After analyzing the data, I used Tesla as the stock to predict the price.

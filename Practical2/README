**Findings**

I loaded the data and performed ridge and linear regression models against the dataset to find the best features.  After cleaning the data I found the 3 best features included
1) Year of vehicle
2) Condition of vehicle (Fair and New being the best features)
3) Type of Vehicle (Sedan and Truck being the best features)

I also found that linear regression was the selected model, but ridge regression had lower MSEs for train and test sets.

**How to Improve**

If I was able to have the processing power, I would have analyzed the full data set. Given kernal issues, I had to limit the dataset to 1000 rows. I'm sure there would be additional insigts had I had the ability to expand the dataset.
